## About Me

I’m a Supply Chain Management student at BYU–Idaho with a strong interest in operations, process improvement, and data-driven decision making. I enjoy working at the intersection of people, processes, and data to improve efficiency and reliability.

I’ve gained hands-on experience through roles in production leadership and as a Spreadsheet Analysis Teaching Assistant, where I worked with Excel, SQL, and operational systems to support workflow improvements and decision-making in fast-paced environments.

I’m particularly interested in supply chain analyst, operations, and continuous improvement roles that allow me to apply analytical tools while collaborating closely with cross-functional teams. I value clear communication, accountability, and continuous learning.

This portfolio highlights selected projects that demonstrate my technical skills and problem-solving approach, with an emphasis on practical, real-world applications.
